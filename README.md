# Doddgy Dave Stock App

## About

This Stock App was designed with OpenAI's API and Polygon's API and Hosted using Cloudflare's workers and pages.

A live Demo of the app can be found [here](https://stock-predictions-ai-app-ecl.pages.dev/)

While working on this project, I used Polygon's API to extract stock data over a range of days-as specified by the user, and then leveraged the tools available via OpenAI's Generative Pre-trained Transformer language model(GPT) to anaylze the data received, summarize it and give informed predictions based on it.

Furthermore, I opted to use Cloudflare to host the site because of the Robust tools and real-time analytical data made accessible via Cloudfare Workers
